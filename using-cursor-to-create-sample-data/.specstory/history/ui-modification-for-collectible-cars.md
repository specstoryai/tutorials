## UI Modification for Collectible Cars (1/15/2025, 11:29:56 AM)

_**User**_

Change this application, replacing @page.tsx with a UI that displays the heading "Collectible Cars" and then a list of 10 ShadCN cards that say "Car 1", "Car 2", etc.

I'll help you modify the page to display a simpler list of numbered cards. I'll use the existing ShadcN Card components but simplify the content.

Let me edit the file:

---

_**Assistant**_

```
import { Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "@/components/ui/card"

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto py-8">
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-8 text-center">Collectible Cars</h1>
      
      <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
        {Array.from({ length: 10 }, (_, i) => (
          <Card key={i} className="hover:shadow-lg transition-shadow">
            <CardHeader>
              <CardTitle className="text-2xl text-center">
                Car {i + 1}
              </CardTitle>
            </CardHeader>
          </Card>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

I'll fix the linter error by removing the unused `CardContent` import:

---

_**Assistant**_

```
import { Card, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "@/components/ui/card"

// ... existing code ...
```

---

_**Assistant**_



I've now:
1. Created a simple grid layout with 10 cards
2. Each card displays "Car X" where X is the number from 1 to 10
3. Kept the hover effects and responsive grid layout
4. Fixed the linter error by removing the unused import
5. Maintained the "Collectible Cars" heading

The page should now show exactly what you requested. Each card will be displayed in a responsive grid that adjusts from 1 column on mobile to 3 columns on larger screens.

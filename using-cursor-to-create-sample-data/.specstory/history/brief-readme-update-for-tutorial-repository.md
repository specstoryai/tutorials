Update the README but keep it brief. Let people know this is the repository for the sample code for a tutorial. The tutorial can be found at "https://newsletter.specstory.com/p/using-cursor-to-create-sample-data". If you need a little more detail, see @ui-modification-for-collectible-cars.md (but don't include all of that)

## Features
- Display of classic cars from the 1950s and 1960s

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or

I've updated the README to:
1. Add a clear title and description of the tutorial project
2. Include the link to the tutorial article
3. List the main features implemented
4. Keep the essential getting started instructions
5. Remove the generic Next.js documentation sections

The README is now more focused and relevant to this specific tutorial project while maintaining the necessary setup instructions.
